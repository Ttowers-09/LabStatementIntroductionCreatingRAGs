# LabStatementIntroductionCreatingRAGs
This lab is designed to introduce students to the fundamental concepts and practical implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generators (RAGs) using OpenAI’s tools and LangChain framework. By the end of the lab, students will have gained hands-on experience building and understanding RAGs, culminating in the delivery of two GitHub repositories.
